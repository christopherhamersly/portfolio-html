    <Typography variant='h5'className = {classes.aboutMeSmall}> I started my professional career as a screen printer.  I've done everything from running a press, to running my own shop, to criss-crossing the country printing in front of live audiences.  I started to learn coding while looking for an app on the market that didn't exist.  Over a year later I'm still learning everyday, and excited to see where this journey takes me.  </Typography>
